## How does language experience affect small quantity object tracking?
Representing small quantities (i.e., 1â€“3) is thought to be independent of language (Carey, 2009). However, recent findings from  the Study of Language and Math (SLAM) Project suggest that timing of language exposure (from birth vs. later) may influence <b>small quantity object tracking.</b> Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) children with <b>language access starting from birth</b> (e.g. DHH children with deaf signing parents) performed better on a small quantity object tracking task compared to DHH children with later access to language (e.g. born to hearing parents and started acquiring spoken English via hearing technology or ASL at a signing school). While language modality (signed vs. spoken) did not predict object tracking performance, <b>knowledge of the cardinal principle</b> (understanding number word meanings) did. Children who were cardinal principle (CP) knowers performed significantly better on a small quantity object tracking task than children who were not CP-knowers. Current research directions involve investigating other predictors of object tracking performance.

## How are handshape preferences shared (or not) amongst homesigners and their communication partners?
Homesigners are deaf individuals with no access to signed or spoken language who innovate gesture systems in order to communicate with the hearing people around them (Brentari & Coppola, 2012). Since there is typically no contact between homesigners and thus no actual linguistic community, each homesigner must <b>create their own unique system</b> to use with their communication partners, the hearing family members and friends who interact with the homesigner.  Current research seeks to investigate whether <b>handshape patterns for labeling objects,</b> a common typological variation that exists in sign languages, are <b>shared by homesigners and their communication partners.</b> More broadly, this research aims to address the question of whether there is a universal tendency for specific types of handshape when naming objects. Future research will explore factors that influence handshape pattern sharing within families.
