I'm a second year graduate student in the Department of Psychological Sciences at the University of Connecticut. I work in the [Language Creation Lab](https://languagecreationlab.uconn.edu/) with Dr. Marie Coppola. I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2018 with a BA in Psychology and Linguistics and am currently pursuing a PhD in developmental psychology. 

Currently, I'm involved in the [Study of Language and Math (SLaM)](https://slam.uconn.edu/). I am also a trainee for the [Science of Learning and Art of Communication (SLAC)](http://slac.uconn.edu/) and an affiliate of the [Connecticut Institute for the Brain and Cognitive Sciences (IBACS)](https://ibacs.uconn.edu/).

My research interests include both number cognition and language emergence. Specifically I am interested in (1) how language experience can affect math knowledge and (2) how homesign systems, which are created by deaf individuals with no access to signed or spoken language, vary across and within families.
