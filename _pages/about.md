I'm a research scientist in the Department of Psychological Sciences at the University of Connecticut, working in the [Language Creation Lab](https://languagecreationlab.uconn.edu/) with Dr. Marie Coppola. I just earned my PhD in Developmental Psychology at UConn in 2024, and graduated from the University of Chicago in 2018 with a BA in Psychology and Linguistics. 

Currently, I'm involved in the [Study of Language and Math (SLaM)](https://slam.uconn.edu/). I am also an affiliate of the [Connecticut Institute for the Brain and Cognitive Sciences (IBACS)](https://ibacs.uconn.edu/) and a trainee in the [Science of Learning and Art of Communication (SLAC)](http://slac.uconn.edu/). I have just completed graduate certificates in the [Neurobiology of Language program](https://nbl.cogsci.uconn.edu/) and the [Cognitive Science program](https://cogsci.uconn.edu/) at UConn.

Broadly, I'm interested in how language influences cognition. My research interests include both number cognition and language emergence. Specifically I am interested in (1) how language experience can affect math knowledge and other foundational concepts and (2) how homesign systems, which are created by deaf individuals with no access to signed or spoken language, vary across and within families.

Early access to language is super important. This includes sign languages!
